# EDA
### This project is to demonstrate exploratory data analysis of a given dataset.
The data chosen for the analysis is Prosper Loan(Peer to Peer loan) data and I used univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis to understand the relationships between different factors like credit/loan history, ratings, loan rates and delinquencies.
I created a linear model to estimate for yields of the investors investing in a particular loan.
The project uses R markdown (R programming language) and was knitted as HTML
